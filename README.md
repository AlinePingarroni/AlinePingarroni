## About Me

Hi there! I am an **Associate Professor** at the Facultad de Estudios Superiores Iztacala, **Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico (UNAM)**, in Tlalnepantla de Baz, Estado de M√©xico, Mexico.

### My Research Focus
My research explores the dynamics of **social-ecological systems**, analyzing the intricate relationships between people and ecosystems. My work is interdisciplinary and spans three main areas:

1. **Biodiversity, Ecosystem Services, and Human Well-being**: Investigating the sociocultural, biophysical, and ecological dimensions of these relationships.
2. **Vegetation Diversity and Regeneration**: Studying plant diversity and regeneration in tropical landscapes affected by human activities.
3. **Conservation and Sustainable Management Strategies**: Developing evidence-based strategies for conservation and sustainable management through interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches.

### Areas of Expertise
- **Agroforestry and Agroecology**: Designing innovative production systems that regenerate ecosystem processes, strengthen local economies, and promote food sovereignty.
- **Geoinformatics and Land Planning**: Integrating advanced tools and methods for comprehensive land use planning and project design.
- **Climate Change Mitigation**: Applying methodologies such as Keyline design, Holistic Management, the Regrarians Platform, and Permaculture design.

### Community Involvement
I am actively engaged with the **Ecosystem Services Partnership (ESP)** and the **Youth in Ecosystem Services Science (YESS)** community. Additionally, I am preparing a proposal to establish a **Geoinformatics Unit** at my institution to enhance postgraduate education and faculty development.

## About Me

Hi there! I am an **Associate Professor** at the Facultad de Estudios Superiores Iztacala, **Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM)**

### My Research Focus
My research explores the dynamics of **social-ecological systems**, analyzing the intricate relationships between people and ecosystems. My work is interdisciplinary and spans three main areas:

1. **Biodiversity, Ecosystem Services, and Human Well-being**: Investigating the sociocultural, biophysical, and ecological dimensions of these relationships.
2. **Landscape Ecology**: Studying plant diversity and regeneration in tropical landscapes affected by human activities.
3. **Conservation and Sustainable Management Strategies**: Developing evidence-based strategies for conservation and sustainable management through interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches.

### Areas of Expertise
- **Socioecological Systems Analysis**: Investigating the dynamics and interconnections between societies and ecosystems.
- **Ecosystem Services and Biodiversity Evaluation**: Conducting sociocultural and biophysical assessments to understand ecosystem benefits.
- **Community Conservation Strategies**: Designing participatory and community-driven approaches for conservation.
- **Spatial Modeling and Mapping**: Utilizing geospatial tools to analyze and visualize ecological patterns and processes.
- **Biodiversity and Human Well-being**: Exploring the critical links between biodiversity and quality of life.
- **Participatory Mapping**: Engaging communities in the co-creation of spatial knowledge.
- **Social Perceptions and Preferences Analysis**: Understanding societal values and preferences regarding nature and its management.
- **Nature-based Solutions**: Promoting sustainable strategies to address environmental and social challenges.
- **Nature’s Values in Decision-making**: Highlighting the importance of ecosystem values for informed policy and management decisions.


### Community Involvement
I am actively engaged with the **Ecosystem Services Partnership (ESP)** and the **Youth in Ecosystem Services Science (YESS)** community. Additionally, I am preparing a proposal to establish a **Geoinformatics Unit** at my institution to enhance postgraduate education and faculty development.
